 Tokyo Free White Next.js Javascript Dashboard is built using the latest industry standards and features a clean and premium design style, making use of colors and accents to improve the user experience for all included flows and pages.

It is powered by Next.js, Javascript and React and contains multiple components customized on top of Material-UI – which is one of the best UI components frameworks available.
We keep all dependencies updated to their latest stable versions. Each time we release an updated version you will be notified via the email you used to initially download the template.

To discover all the features that this free React admin template has to offer, we suggest visiting the live preview we’ve set up.

There is also a free Javascript version available, if that is what you prefer working with.
